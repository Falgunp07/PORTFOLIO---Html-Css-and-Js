# Personal Portfolio – HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This is the first version of my personal portfolio website, built using
vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate strong web development
fundamentals such as semantic markup, responsive layouts, and clean UI
design.

This version serves as the foundation before rebuilding the portfolio
using React with a component-based architecture.
